# NFL Data Science Project 🏈✨

## Overview 📝 
As a software engineer looking to expand into the data science world, I created this introductory project analyzing NFL player statistics. This project combines web scraping, data manipulation, and statistical analysis to answer interesting questions about player performance across different positions.

## Technologies Used 💻

### Python Libraries 🐍
- **pandas** - Data manipulation and analysis library for working with structured datasets
- **matplotlib** - Comprehensive plotting library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations
- **scipy** - Scientific computing library providing statistical functions and hypothesis testing tools
- **sklearn** - Machine learning library offering data preprocessing and analytical tools
- **seaborn** - Statistical data visualization library built on matplotlib for creating attractive graphs

### Statistical Tools Applied 📊
- **Pearson Correlation Coefficient** - Measures linear correlation between two variables
- **One Sample T-Test** - Compares a sample mean against a hypothesized population mean to test for significant differences
- **One-Way ANOVA** - ANOVA test comparing means across multiple groups to determine if any significant differences exist
- **Spearman Correlation** - Measures monotonic correlation between variables
- **Independent Samples T-Test** - Compares means between two independent groups to test for statistically significant differences

## Approach 🌟
This project focused on statistical analysis of NFL data to answer questions about player performance, efficiency metrics, and positional comparisons. I scraped the 2024 season data from official sources and applied various statistical methods to uncover meaningful patterns and relationships in the data.

## Limitations 🙈
- **Data Scope**: Due to pagination handling limitations, datasets are restricted to the top 25 players in each statistical category
- **Analysis Focus**: As an introductory project, the emphasis was on exploratory data analysis rather than predictive modeling
- **Temporal Scope**: Analysis limited to 2024 season data without historical comparisons

## Future Improvements 🚀
- Get ALL the players (not just the top 25 superstars ⭐)
- Keep the data fresh with real-time updates
- Actually predict things like who's going to have a breakout game 
- Look at historical trends
- Build some fancy ML models for player comparisons

## Learning Outcomes 🎉
This project was my fun little bridge from software engineering to data science! I got to play with statistics while analyzing something entertaining which made learning Python's data science tools more enjoyable.
